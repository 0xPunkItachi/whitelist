ðŸ“˜ Overview

Dynamic Staking Whitelist is an on-chain access control system that dynamically whitelists users based on how much they stake.
It is a fully self-contained smart contract with no imports, no constructors, and no external dependencies, making it portable and lightweight.

Users stake native tokens (in wei) to earn whitelisted access to different roles (tiers).
The whitelist updates automatically when a userâ€™s stake increases or decreases.
